/**
 * Assert that the browser viewer actually built.
 *
 * `codegraph ui` serves dist/viewer/ as static files. If that tree is missing
 * or half-written, the CLI still starts and the browser gets a 404 — a failure
 * that would otherwise surface after the release is published. So the build
 * fails here instead: index.html must exist, be non-trivial, and every local
 * asset it references must be on disk next to it.
 *
 * It also re-asserts that the compiled engine is still there. The viewer build
 * empties its own output directory, and `dist/ui/` — the obvious name — is
 * where tsc puts the TERMINAL ui, so a mis-pointed outDir silently deletes
 * modules the CLI requires at startup.
 *
 * (The tree-sitter wasm grammars this once checked went with the wasm path in
 * Phase 5 of kernel-only-extraction-plan.md; the engine's parser is the
 * native kernel, checked by build-bundle.sh.)
 * and for the same reason. They are copied by `npm run copy-assets`, they are
 * what both indexing and the viewer's syntax classification parse with, and
 * their absence is survivable at runtime — source is served unhighlighted —
 * which is exactly why it has to fail here: nothing downstream would complain.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-ui-build.mjs [--root <dir>]
 *   --root  directory holding dist/ (default: the repo root). The release
 *           bundler points this at its staging dir to verify the copy.
